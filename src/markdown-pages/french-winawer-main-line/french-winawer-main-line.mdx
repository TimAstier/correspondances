## Intro

The French Winawer "Poisoned Pawn Variation" is one of the most classic position in the French.  
The position of interest in this study arises after the following moves:

`1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3 6.axc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 Qc7 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 10.Ne2 Nc6 11.f4 dxc3 12 Qd3 d4`

<Chessground
  fen="r1b1k1r1/ppq1np2/2n1p3/4P3/3p1P2/P1pQ4/2P1N1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQq - 0 13"
  viewOnly
  orientation="black"
  height={320}
  width={320}
/>

12...d4 is more modern than the traditional 12...Bd7 move.  
Both sides needs to be extremely precise in this position.

White has many moves for move 13. Here is the most popular continuation:

`13.Nxd4 Nxd4 14.Qxd4 Bd7`

<Chessground
  fen="r3k1r1/ppqbnp2/4p3/4P3/3Q1P2/P1p5/2P3PP/R1B1KB1R w KQq - 1 15"
  viewOnly
  orientation="black"
  height={320}
  width={320}
/>

Note that the immediate 14...Nf5 that I have played in [some occasions](https://lichess.org/lBf4gwdK/black#28) is a mistake, because White is on time to disrupt Black's position with 15.Bb5+

The critical line goes:

`15.Rg1`

White prepares g4 to challenge any Knight that would occupy f5.

`15...Nf5`

Black accepts the challenge and forces White's next move.

`16.Qf2`

The only move.

`// TODO` Other moves as exercises.

`16...Qc6`

Black needs to anticipate a response to g4. Under no circomstances would the Knight go backwards. Qc6 prepares to meet g4 with Qe4+ and ideas of Nd4 targeting c2.

// TODO: What to do vs g4 (g4 Qe4+ Qe2)

`17.Bd3`

Taking away the e4 square for the Queen.

`17...Qd5`  
Allowing Nd4 in response to g4.

<Chessground
  fen="r3k1r1/pp1b1p2/4p3/3qPn2/5P2/P1pB4/2P2QPP/R1B1K1R1 w Qq - 7 18"
  viewOnly
  orientation="black"
  height={320}
  width={320}
/>

Most common here are 18.Rb1 and 18.Be3. Be3 is the most testing and Black really needs to know their stuff.

// TODO: 18.Rb1

`18.Be3 Nxe3 19.Qxe3 Rxh2 20.Rxh2 Qxh2 21.Be4 Qxh2 22.0-0-0 Bc6 23.Kb1 Bxe4 24.Qxe4`

Black has only one move to draw.

// Train: 23.Kb1 and 23.Bxc6

`24...Qf2 25.Qxb7 Qb6+ 26.Qxb6 axb6 27.Ka2 Ra4`

The rook endgame is a draw.

## Main plans for White main moves

## Common tactics

`// TODO`: // Why Ne7 first?  
`// TODO`: Qa5 idea if White Plays Qg4 first followed by a3.  
`// TODO`: 5. Qg4 is an innacuracy because after 5...c5 only 6.Nf3 and 6.dxc5 are reasonable options.  
`// TODO`: What if no f4?
