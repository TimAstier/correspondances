## This is kinda cool

No matter how you think, you are always in the Now.
No matter what you do you are always making the right choice.
What you chose to do is what was meant to happen.
Uncounscious choices help you grow on the dimensions you have in mind.
Conscious choices help you grow on the dimensions you are not yet aware of.
Let it go and let it happen.
This is why it all makes sense when looking backwards.

Signs are manifestations of the world that your subcounscious notice and interprets.
The very fact that you noticed them and understand them as you did is the important part.
If the path is already chosen for you and you heart knows it, following your heart intuition is the way.
They are the opportunity for the Divine living in your subcounscious to bring concious awareness on the path you should take.
